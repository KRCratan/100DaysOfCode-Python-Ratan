# Day 1 — Installation & Setup

## Objective

Set up your Python development environment and learn how Python executes scripts.

---

## 1. Install Python

Download Python from the official website:

[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Verify the installation:

```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

Expected output:

```
Python 3.14.2
```

---

## 2. Install an IDE

Choose one of the recommended IDEs:

### Visual Studio Code

Download: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Install the **Python Extension** by Microsoft.

### PyCharm Community Edition

Download: [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

Both provide:

* Syntax highlighting
* Automatic formatting
* Debugging tools
* Integrated terminal

---

## 3. How Python Runs Scripts

A Python program is stored in a file ending with `.py`.

Run any Python script from your terminal:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

or on some systems:

```bash
python3 script_name.py
```

### Running inside an IDE

* **VS Code:** Use the “Run Python File” button (▶).
* **PyCharm:** Click the green run arrow.

---

## 4. Test Your Environment

Create a file named `test.py`:

```python
print("Python is installed and working!")
```

Run it:

```bash
python test.py
```

If the message prints, your installation is successful.

---

## 5. Explore the Python Documentation

The official Python tutorial is the best starting point:

[https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

Focus today on:

* Section 1 — Overview
* Section 2 — Using the Python Interpreter

---

## 6. Recommended Project Structure

```
100DaysOfCode/
│
├── Day1/
│   ├── notes.md
│   ├── code.py
│   ├── practice.py
└── README.md
```

This keeps your work organized as you progress over the next 100 days.

## 7. Day 1 Summary

By completing Day 1, you should be able to:

* Install Python
* Install and configure an IDE
* Run Python scripts
* Understand where to find official Python learning resources

You are ready to proceed to **Day 2 — Python Basics (print, variables, types).**
