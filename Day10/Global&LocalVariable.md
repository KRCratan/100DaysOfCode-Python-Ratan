# Global and Local Variables
## Local Variables
Local variables are created inside a function and exist only during its execution. They cannot be accessed from outside the function.
Example 1: In this code, we are creating and accessing a local variable inside a function.
```python
def greet():
    msg = "Hello from inside the function!"
    print(msg)

greet()
```
Output
Hello from inside the function!

Explanation: We define greet() with a local variable msg and print it. Since msg exists only during the function's execution, it's accessed within the function. Calling greet() displays the message.

Example 2: In this example, we are creating a local variable inside a function and then trying to access it outside the function, which causes an error.
```python
def greet():
    msg = "Hello!"
    print("Inside function:", msg)

greet()
print("Outside function:", msg)
```
Output: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/guest/sandbox/Solution.py", line 6, in <module>
    print("Outside function:", msg)
NameError: name 'msg' is not defined

Explanation: msg is a local variable inside greet() and can only be accessed there. Printing it outside causes an error because it doesn't exist globally.

# Global Variables
Global variables are declared outside all functions and can be accessed anywhere in the program, including inside functions.

In this example, we are creating a global variable and then accessing it both inside and outside a function.
```python
msg = "Python is awesome!"

def display():
    print("Inside function:", msg)

display()
print("Outside function:", msg)
```
Output
Inside function: Python is awesome!
Outside function: Python is awesome!

Explanation: msg is a global variable accessible both inside and outside the display() function. Calling display() prints the global msg and printing msg outside the function works as expected.

***Note: If a variable is not found inside a function (local scope), Python automatically looks for it in global scope. However, if a local variable has same name as a global one, it will shadow global variable inside that function.***

## Use of Local and Global variables
If a variable is defined both globally and locally with the same name, the local variable shadows the global variable inside the function. Changes to the local variable do not affect the global variable unless you explicitly declare the variable as global.
```python
def fun():
    s = "Me too."
    print(s)

s = "I love Geeksforgeeks"
fun()   
print(s)
```
Output
Me too.
I love Geeksforgeeks

Explanation: Inside fun(), s is a local variable set to "Me too." and prints that value. Outside, the global s remains "I love Geeksforgeeks", so printing s afterward shows the global value.

## Modifying Global Variables Inside a Function
By default, one cannot modify a global variable inside a function without declaring it as global. If you try, Python will raise an error because it treats variable as local. To modify a global variable use the global keyword.

### Without global (causes error)
```python
def fun():
    s += ' GFG'   # Error: Python thinks s is local
    print(s)

s = "I love GeeksforGeeks"
fun()
```
Output
UnboundLocalError: local variable 's' referenced before assignment

Explanation: Inside fun(), Python assumes s is local since we try to modify it. But no local s exists before that line, so an error occurs.

### With global (works correctly)
```python
s = "Python is great!"

def fun():
    global s
    s += " GFG"   # Modify global variable
    print(s)
    s = "Look for GeeksforGeeks Python Section"  # Reassign global
    print(s)

fun()
print(s)
```
Output
Python is great! GFG
Look for GeeksforGeeks Python Section
Look for GeeksforGeeks Python Section

Explanation:

- Declaring s as global tells Python to use the variable from the global scope.
- The function first appends " GFG", then reassigns s.
- Changes persist outside the function.

### Global vs Local with Same Name
```python
a = 1  # Global variable

def f():
    print("f():", a)  # Uses global a

def g():
    a = 2  # Local shadows global
    print("g():", a)

def h():
    global a
    a = 3  # Modifies global a
    print("h():", a)

print("global:", a)
f()
print("global:", a)
g()
print("global:", a)
h()
print("global:", a)
```
Output
global: 1
f(): 1
global: 1
g(): 2
global: 1
h(): 3
global: 3

Explanation:

- f() prints global a without changing it.
- g() creates a local a, leaving global one untouched.
- h() declares a as global and modifies it.

| **Lifetime**            | Created when the program starts and destroyed when it ends | Created when the function is called and destroyed when it returns |
| **Data Sharing**        | Shared across all functions                          | Not shared; exists only within its function         |
| **Scope**               | Can be accessed anywhere in the program              | Accessible only inside the function                |
| **Parameters Needed**   | No parameter passing needed                          | May be created through parameters or assignments inside the function |
| **Storage**             | Managed in the global namespace                      | Stored in the function’s local namespace (stack frame) |
| **Value Impact**        | Changes affect the entire program                    | Changes are local and don’t affect other functions  |
