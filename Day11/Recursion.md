# Recursion
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself either directly or indirectly to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller, simpler subproblems.

In Python, recursion is especially useful for problems that can be divided into identical smaller tasks, such as mathematical calculations, tree traversals or divide-and-conquer algorithms.
